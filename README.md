#  PhotogrammeTree 🌲➡️🌳 Climate Disaster Mitigation 🌍

This project uses **LiDAR** data 🛰️ and **orthophotos** 📸 combined with **3D semantic segmentation** 🤖 and FEA/FDS to identify and analyze mutable candidates for climate risk mitigation.

## The Goal 🎯

Our aim is to pinpoint specific areas or objects within a 3D environment (e.g., vegetation, buildings, infrastructure) that can be modified or managed to reduce climate-related risks like flooding, heat islands, or wildfire spread.

For example, we could:
*   Identify vegetation likely to be a vector for fire spread to buildings.
*   Find optimal placements for floodwalls, sandbags, or home risers.
*   Detect rooftops suitable for conversion to steel roofs 🌿 or solar panel installations ☀️.
*   Assess infrastructure vulnerabilities that need reinforcement.

## Technologies 🛠️

*   **LiDAR:** For creating accurate 3D point clouds of the environment.
*   **Orthophotos:** Georeferenced aerial imagery providing color and texture information.
*   **3D Semantic Segmentation:** Machine learning models to classify objects within the 3D point cloud (e.g., ground, buildings, low vegetation, high vegetation).

## Workflow Overview (Conceptual) 🗺️

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Collect LiDAR scans and orthophotos.
    *   Align and fuse these datasets.
    *   Colorize the LiDAR point cloud using orthophoto imagery.
2.  **3D Semantic Segmentation:**
    *   Train or use a pre-trained model to classify points in the cloud (e.g., using Open3D-ML).
3.  **Candidate Identification & Analysis:**
    *   Develop algorithms to analyze the segmented point cloud.
    *   Identify "mutable" objects/areas based on their class and properties.
    *   Evaluate their potential for climate risk mitigation.
4.  **Physics-Based Simulation & ML Analysis 🌪️🔥🌊:**
    *   Run Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) simulations on the segmented point cloud.
    *   Simulate physical phenomena like fires, floods, and high winds.
    *   Utilize Machine Learning to analyze simulation results and refine mitigation strategies.
5.  **Visualization & Reporting:**
    *   Visualize the results in 3D.
    *   Generate reports for decision-making.
